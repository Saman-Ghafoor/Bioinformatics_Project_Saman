Saman 04032213039, I was given an unknown sequence , I did the DNA ,RNA, Potein analysis by converting DNA sequence to amino acid sequence and also checked multiple sequence alignment , interactions of target protein with others by using Different Bioinformatic tools. DNA sequence alighnment, RNA stable structure, protein secondary structure ,domains and properties , Phylogenetic tree , subcellular localization of protein was recorded. Based on these all results I conclude that the unknown sequence was MFS transport Protein, of streptomyces Laurentii, located in the cytoplasmic membrane. NCBi BLAST, ORF FINDER ,EXPASY, UNIPROT, VIENNA RNA WEB SERVER, CLUSTALW,PFAM PREDICTPROTEIN, CELLO, TARGETP, STRING and other tools were used for this analysis. THANKS to professor Samina Shakeel for guiding to complete this project.
