Saman 04032213039, The given raw DNA sequence corresponds to a highly conserved Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporter protein of Streptomyces laurentii, which is localized in the cell membrane.
In this study, DNA, RNA, and protein sequence analyses were performed using various bioinformatics tools to comprehensively characterize the sequence and gain deeper insights into its structure, function, and molecular interactions. These analyses helped in understanding the biological significance and functional role of the MFS transporter protein.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my esteemed professor, Dr. Samina Shakeel, for her valuable guidance and support in learning and applying bioinformatics tools throughout this project.
